The solution involves adding specific props to the `<Camera>` component to improve compatibility.  The exact solution might vary depending on the device and the specific nature of the distortion or black screen.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  // ... (rest of the code remains the same)

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Camera 
        style={{ flex: 1 }} 
        type={type} 
        ratio="16:9"  //Adding a ratio prop
        autoFocus={Camera.Constants.AutoFocus.on} // added autofocus prop
      >
       {/* rest of the code here */}
      </Camera>
    </View>
  );
};
```

Adding `ratio` and `autoFocus` props often helps resolve this issue. Experiment with different ratio values ('16:9', '4:3', etc.) to find one that works best for your devices.  In some cases, you might need to explore further options within the Expo Camera API documentation to optimize your app's camera performance.
